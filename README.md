# _Tamagotchi_

#### By _**Stephen Trewick**_

## Description

This exercise was designed in C#, MVC.Net framework, and is mostly practice with the .Net framework using RESTful routing and CRUD methods. I created a timer for practice as well. For the user, the application starts when the user gives a name to their tamagotchi pet. A timer is implemented to add hunger, sleepiness, and boredom to the object. The user keeps the tamagotchi healthy by clicking a Feed, Sleep, and Play button. If any of the object's properties reach 20, the object dies.

----------

## Setup/Installation Requirements

In the terminal, `cd ` to the directory folder.

Then `cd` to `Tamagotchi` folder.

Run `dotnet build` and `dotnet run` to compile.

Using a web browser, go to localhost:5000 to load the application.

Enjoy!
